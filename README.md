The Tech Talk DC community is made up of an assortment of professionals and volunteers with different levels of understanding and personal beliefs. This diversity is one of Tech Talk DC’s strengths, and Tech Talk DC is dedicated to providing a diverse and inclusive community experience for everyone. Therefore, Tech Talk DC prohibits any form of bullying or harassment at all events (including talks, hack nights, and in public spaces such as bars), online discussions on forums and chatrooms, and code projects (including issue discussions and pull requests).

Harassment includes, but not limited to: 
* Unwelcomed conduct that is based on: race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic. 
* Offensive physical actions, written or spoken, and graphic communication (for example, obscene hand or finger gestures or sexually explicit pictures). 
* Any type of physical contact when the action is unwelcomed by recipient (for example, intentionally brushing up against someone). 
* Expectations, requests, demands or pressure for sexual favors. 
* Slurs, jokes, posters, cartoons, and gestures that are offensive, 
* Sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Bullying includes, but not limited to, one or more of the following forms:
* Verbal abuse.
* Offensive behaviors that are threatening, humiliating or intimidating.
* Work interference or sabotage that prevents work from getting done.

If a community participant engages in bullying or harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund, if applicable. If you are harassed, notice harassment or offensive activities, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. Participants asked to stop any bullying or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors of community events are also subject to the anti-bullying and anti-harassment policy and in particular, should not use offensive images, activities, or other material. In addition, Representatives from sponsor organizations should not use offensive clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create an offensive, intimidating, hostile, or unwelcoming environment.

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for minor problems, although a community organizer should speak to the presenter afterward. If a presentation or event repeatedly or seriously violates this Code of Conduct, the community organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop the presentation or event. (For example, simply say “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time” with no further explanation.)

We value your attendance, and want you to feel comfortable, safe, and supported.

We expect participants and organizers to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related social events.

It is through thoughtful dialog and careful listening that we can encourage each other to do great things. We are committed to making Tech Talk DC a place where you can develop and share your skills, both as they relate to programming and to communication.

>“Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” ― Dalai Lama XIV
